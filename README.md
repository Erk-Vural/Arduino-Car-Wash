# Arduino Car Wash Program

The Arduino Car Wash Program is designed to simulate the operation of a car wash system using Arduino and C++, with the circuit simulated in Proteus.

## Features

- **Arduino Programming**: Develop the car wash program using Arduino and C++ to interact with different components of the system.
- **Circuit Simulation**: Simulate the car wash system circuit using Proteus, allowing for testing and validation of the program before implementation in hardware.

## Technologies Used

- Arduino
- C++
- Proteus

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/arduino-car-wash.git
   ```

2. Open the Arduino IDE or your preferred C++ IDE.

3. Load the Arduino code (`car_wash.ino`) into the IDE.

4. Compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.

5. Open Proteus and load the car wash system circuit simulation.

6. Simulate the circuit to test the car wash program.

## Usage

1. Connect the Arduino board to the car wash system hardware.

2. Power on the Arduino board and initiate the car wash program.

3. Follow the prompts to control the different stages of the car wash process.

4. Monitor the simulation in Proteus to ensure proper operation of the car wash system.
